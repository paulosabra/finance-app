This project serves as a practical exercise in mobile app development, focusing on the challenge of recreating a Finance App developed with Flutter, based on the lessons taught by Kaio C. de Oliveira. Follow the journey of development and learning with Flutter here.

## Objectives

The main objective of this course is to provide practical development experience with Flutter, by building a Finance App. The course will be complemented by texts on [Medium](https://medium.com/code-review/fiz-um-aplicativo-de-gest%C3%A3o-financeira-com-flutter-3051ccf08406) and videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtlg0Apoubs_xVS8QxIX51zl0iucEcKyK), offering a gradual and accessible approach for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Architecture
For the architectural organization of the project, the use of the MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller) was considered from the outset. This choice was made due to its accessibility and comprehensibility, especially for initial projects.

## Prototype
The visual design of the project was based on a prototype made available by the Figma community, developed by Irvan Moses. You can access the original prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1080339303735258826).
